##  Problem
The manual returns process had multiple delays, manual logging, and poor customer communication, resulting in refund cycles of 7–14 days.

##  Approach

- Created swimlane diagrams to visualize process steps.  
- Developed stakeholder personas and their goals/pain points.  
- Wrote user stories aligned with Agile practices.

##  Outcome
- Automated refund process triggered within 48 hours.  
- Returns cycle time reduced to **3–5 days**.  
- Improved customer satisfaction with real-time updates.

##  Tools Used
Lucidchart (process mapping), MS Word (docs), PowerPoint (summary deck)
